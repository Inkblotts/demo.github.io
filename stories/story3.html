            <h2><p><br>“Isn’t it wonderful to be loved by someone”, mused Shoshanna as she sat beside HIM one fine evening. “Yes, it really is!” He joined in. “What is LOVE to you?” asked SHE, “A magic wand that weaves dreams, an invincible glue that binds strangers together ,a magic power that keeps the world alive” HE replied. “Yeah, isn’t it the harmony that inspires music or the drink that heals the sick” SHE further added. Their lovely conversation continued thereafter.
Have you ever wondered that Love is the greatest and the most basic commandment: “Love the lord your GOD… Love your neighbor…”
Just like every time, this time too, He had been posted to a new location. Since His profession involved a lot of traveling, every time a new place, he gets to learn a bunch of new facts and gather new experiences. So this frequent changing of locations used to break the monotony for Him and provided the necessary kick in life that He often searched for. But this time His joy was never ending because She was there with him.One fine morning he landed in the land of endless discoveries and yes, indeed he did discover a lot. Located at the western edge of the Tibetan Plateau, its landscape has been carefully modified and sculpted into its spectacular shape by wind and water erosion over the millennia. Despite the rugged terrain and difficult climatic conditions, the people here exhibit a natural joie de vivre and warm disposition, so was She. Their custom and lifestyle are a continuum from the past and the cultural traditions are virtually alive and colorful, just like their relationship. This was their first trip together in the place which they both liked much, the hills, which promised to be so complete, so enchanting, so true…
A push. Just a little force applied in the horizontal direction perpendicular to HIS chest.
A push that took her life light years away from him. As he slipped his first step, time froze. Everything in nature came to a sudden halt. As he tried to clutch her hand, hands slipped and down he fell from the 7,135m cliff of the Ladakh (Nun-Kun), slowly drifting through the misty clouds going far from her and nearing the earth. Gravity !!!…loved him.
He came silently like the cold breezy winter wind, touched her brilliantly dimpled cheeks and virtual vanished into infinity without creating any impression on her.
That very day sunlight had kissed the Karakoram Range and the intoxicating smell of some unknown flower had saturated the atmosphere, a strange sweetness overpowered HIM.  HE held HER hand fingers entwined. THEIR palms were warm with innocent love. HE picked up a wild flower, knelt and promised HIS love to HER. SHE was indifferent …HE was so silly. HER radiant face used to light up HIS immaterial self and HE felt a sense of longing. Clutching to HER hand HE went nearer to the cliff.
That day as SHE was holding HIS hand, memories of the time spent together crossed HIS mind-the day they took selfie at Pangong, bought for her pashmina from Tso-moriri, went on a long ride on the world’s highest motorable road at Khardung-la, and even prayed together at Ladakh’s biggest monastery-Hemis. All HE could perceive was an innocent sense of joy and simplicity. THEIR love was so fresh and young it seemed amalgamed with nature so agreeably.They reached the side; HE left HER hand and walked a few steps forward, towards the edge. It was dangerous yet thrilling. HE turned around, facing HER, and opened HIS arms. HER face, looked so mysteriously cold and beautiful, SHE ran up to HIM. Sweet, longed for, blissful memories sank into HIS brain. SHE came closer and touched HIS chest with HER hand. She took her first step and he leaned back, as he misplaced his first step, a nefarious smile spread across her beautiful face and as he tried to clutch her hand, he realized that it was never there for him. NEVER. Earlier, not a second used to pass that he would not think of her someway but that moment HE was certain that she would never be his and he cannot get it back.
Down…..as he drifted through the clouds slowly sinking into infinity he heard her laughter, cracking the stillness, shattering the silence and echoing in the valley. Everything suddenly became blur and his fall started to speed as he was nearing gravity proving gravity’s intensity of love for him. The mother of all, with her lost radiance, lost warmth….still standing there on the cliff peeping to be sure of something.
The very next day everything set back to normal, but her laughter remained forever, piercing the nature and its laws.
This is funny because somewhere down the line I am dead and someone else is born as a result.
