            <h2><p><br><strong>They say—“Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.” Needless to say that a beautiful flower cannot make a garden, yet a true friend can build a world. It’s just not about the hours of speaking to each other; it’s about those uncounted minutes that are spent in little feuds. It’s not about supporting one when one is wrong, it’s about the powerful consolation which one gives to one’s angry or sad friend. Love, enmity, affection—everything in this world can be one-sided. But friendship can never be so. It stands on the firm base of four things. First comes trust—the common building block of all relationships. It is that element which assures both of us that if one of us falls prey to evil circumstances, the other will be there to save that person. Secondly, we have compassion—something which is required in all adversities of life. Then, we have acceptance—for we have been able to build up such a strong bond despite knowing our limitations. Finally comes love—yes we do love each other. That love which makes one worried for one’s friend when that person is unwell for days, that love which allows one to confess things to one’s friend without any hesitation, that love which makes one brave enough to sacrifice everything for the sake of friendship. Love resides in friendship—it’s the integral part of every kind of relation on earth. Neither is our friendship enshrouded by the burden of assignments, nor is it tarnished by any give-and-take policy. Our unconditional friendship is a blazing fire—it offers glowing light to those who respect it, but ferociously burns those who try to demean it. The best cosmetic for the lips is truth, for the voice is prayer, for the eyes is pity, for the hands is charity and for the life is FRIENDSHIP.</strong> <br>
