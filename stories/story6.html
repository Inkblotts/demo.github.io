            <h2><p><br>Suppose you just downloaded yourself a pdf version of MSIT INKBLOTTS-the crystal jubilee edition. Its 11:45 p.m. and  you have just finished writing your practical. You feel sleepy but the new edition of Inkblotts seems to present an irresistible charm. Maybe you’d like a smoke, but you’re home and you cant smoke with your parents asleep in the next room. Or maybe you live in a PG, and you do have the opportunity but your friend finished the pack of cigarettes while he was getting drunk, with the other guys. Stupid isn’t he? No shop would be open at this time. Or would there be? But aren’t you too tired to get dressed, go downstairs, hunt for a shop and get a pack? 
So you choose to devote your time in reading the magazine. After all it’s your college magazine. Isn’t it your responsibility to read it? Oh wait! Hadn’t you submitted a prose— a love story? Has it been published? No? You surely feel bummed out. You’re extremely enraged. You feel like throwing away your expensive smartphone. However, you really can’t do that. It would cost you a 10k mobile phone. Expenses are rising by the day. Plus you have to buy those books, which the teachers are telling you to. There’s the list of editors. There’s the name of the senior, with whom you had had a serious conflict, remember? 
You feel like closing the pdf and chat with your friends. You check WhatsApp and somehow you have no unread messages. None of your friends are online. That other WhatsApp group has messages flooding but its that group which you don’t really care about. No notifications on Facebook as well. You could watch a movie, but really aren’t in the mood for one.  
Oh wait, the unit tests are around the corner, and it wouldn’t hurt studying some pages. However, the text books are always repulsive. So, it leaves you no choice but Inkblotts. You are angry, but literature always helps. You flip through the contents, and find an article, by your good friend from another department. It was really great. Its an article about Life. Technology always charges you up. You flip the page and find an article by a senior. You always loved his tiny tales. His story of separated lover’s, nails it. On the next page, there’s this awesome photograph taken by this girl from the club you’re a part of. 
There’s an article above that, with a pretty odd title. ‘Unititled’? What’s that supposed to be? It’s by some Johnny. Doesn’t that name sound familiar? Yes he is on your friend list on Facebook. You have some mutual friends with him. He is in the same department as Subho from school.    
Life is a canvas of confusing strokes and emotional colours   
              8 
He’s that short, fat guy with a dark complexion. He’s pretty fat and always has his adipose tissue stock hanging. Whenever you see him, you find a striking resemblance with Doraemon, don’t you? He always comes to mashi’s place, but can’t even light himself a cigarette. Such a fool. Whenever he sees you, he gives you that handshake which you really detest.  Or that wave with a cheeky smile-a real dunce.  
It’s really worth wondering what he may have written. As far as your intellects go, or as he appears you surely know he can’t pull off anything good. Some typical cheesy love story, where there are feeling unexpressed and so are the words. It may also be something geeky, but he isn’t really that sort of a person. Wait, aren’t you wasting too much time on thinking about him. There are many more articles to read, many other guys to judge. No, no that’s again the wrong thing to do. You’re not judgmental ,are you? Of course not. 
Sit back, relax. You’re not judgmental. Everybody is anybody. You might as well give the article a reading. How bad can it be? It wouldn't be as bad as Chetan Bhagat. The clock has climbed to 1 a.m. You do feel your eyelids are growing heavier by the second. Don’t spread out on the bed, you still have a lot to read. Of course ,you can relax and read. There’s really no reading decorum. So focus and start reading. 
Oh god, it’s morning already?? And its pretty late too. The first class will be taken by Teacher-inCharge sir, you should really rush. You do remember not reading untitled do you? Who cares, its just another article by just another guy. Better get ready. 
Isn't that Johnny trying to drag himself onto the same motorized van rickshaw ,as you are. You really shouldn’t face him. The NRI complex is so beautiful isn’t it?  
Johnny is calling you . You attempt to escape, but somehow he gets hold of you. You had liked his status of asking people to read his article. You should look into what you like on Facebook. He is asking you about the article. What would you reply? You haven’t read it. You were busy judging him. Alright ,not judging just thinking. Should you say ,I would read it later? That would sound odd. Its better to reply by saying-Nice, pretty nice. 
Yes, that’s right. Nice is good. Besides ,how does it matter? Others might complement him. You just made a generic statement. That’s it. In a few days time, everyone would forget about it. So yeah ,its nice. Untitled, is nice.
