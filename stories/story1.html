            <h2><p><br>Life is more precious than anything else in this universe, any denial to that??? Another thing which we cannot deny is that we live in this world of competition, where the unforgiving theory of “Survival of the Fittest” rules everyone’s mind. Education and career are the two most important agenda in everyone’s life. All of us, from our very childhood, are made aware of the consequences of failing in either of these in our future. This spontaneously produces two feelings in us, the ambition of success and the fear of failure, which remains embedded in our heart from childhood to adolescence, from youth to mid-age. 

Students have become, or rather they have been made, so covetous for success that they are never ready to face failure boldly. Suicide is the only way out then. Reports say that about 2000+ Indian students killed themselves in 2009. That’s almost a 35% jump from 2 years before. Board exams, various entrance tests, professional school tests, even high school monthly exams are creating a spate of suicides in India’s student population, an age group that one would normally associate with potential and promise.

The suicide notes from some of those who killed themselves had clues to what drove their tormented souls to take the final plunge which included everything ranging from,
“.......I will come back as a ghost and harass my teacher....”
To
“.......I cannot face my parents and my friends after failing this exam.....”
Or simply,
“I QUIT!”

All these just show that there is some pressure, some driving force that is directing them to just finish off with their life, so as to avoid the shame or their guardian’s anger. Guilt conscience also kills.

To be frank, both the system and the student are responsible for the growing suicide rates of Indian students. It’s pretty selfish to entirely blame the system as they do in the movies. Students today lack the true spirit of competition. The urge for learning is almost totally replaced by the lust for success. Software icon N.R. Narayan Murthy, in a conference, condemned the tendency of students in resorting to role with the sole aim of passing the examination rather than attempting to learn and acquire knowledge.
                “We have not leveraged the power of education. Our students have become people who learn by rote, pass the examination and they are incapable of making a difference to the society”, he said.<a href="story1part2.html"><h4>NEXT</h4></a>
