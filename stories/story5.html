            <h2><p><br>If I am to get plastic surgery, I think I should like to change my whole face and almost all the parts of my body. 
Why?
I have a very simple reason, my dear.
I look much too much like my parents, and I hate them you know. I’m afraid I’m with Oscar Wilde on this one. I simply cannot bring myself to forgive them. I didn’t take to hating them out of a fashion; most children do, in high school, if you liked your parents you wouldn’t have survived a year. 
But my hatred is rather ingrained and valid. 
They are do-gooders. 
Charity, orphans, noblesse oblige, all that sort of thing, they hardly pay me any attention; treat me as though I’m another of their causes.
Do you remember that nasty business last year (of course you don’t, I’ve only just met you)? When I found out that my stuffed bear, Mr. Pook (don’t laugh like that dear, one cannot be held responsible for the names one gives at the age of three) was actually given away to some orphaned destitute? 
I had always thought he was eaten up by the pet dog (yes, that’s quite possible, I saw Mr. Pook’s blue ribbon in his mouth once). 
I came back from school one term and he was gone. Mummy looked very cold, and Papa sniggered to himself. My enquiries fell on deaf ears.
I can hardly bring myself to recount the trauma. The doctor recommended a change of air. 
Although a considerable number of years have passed, (I agree that I had forgotten all about it) only last year I saw Mr. Pook in the arms of one those children Mummy sponsors. 
The reunion was sentimental (I snatched him back).
And that is why I hate my parents. 
I’ve only decided to do something about it now.
But that doesn’t answer your question. 
Yes, I shall undergo plastic surgery. 
But what shall I change? I look too much like my parents.My forehead is Mummy’s, and my face structure is like hers too - round. 
My full lips, my flat nose, my cheeks, they all come from her line.
I can’t decide whose ears I have though. You see, ears are rather squiggly, and very difficult to draw, so it could be either of theirs. And they aren’t my best features.
As for my stature I have only her to blame. But the rest of my features, come from Daddy. 
My limbs are pure Aryan limbs, my legs make for a very good picture, and with heels they can take the shine off a giraffe. 
My wrists are narrow and delicate; you can admire their craftsmanship (the Creator did take time out to make them). And as for these fingers, they don’t need that ring you’re wearing to make them admirable. It’s a pity I didn’t learn to play the piano. The towers of Lebanon have met their match, or was it the cedars?
The nails are their only flaw. 
Even my feet are the finest I have seen in all the woman of my acquaintance. The instep arch can only be rivalled by Trilby’s (since she is fictional, I win hands down). 
Again the flat nails are their only flaw.Now to touch upon that delicate issue: my figure. You see had the Creator blessed me that too, I dare say a riot of sorts would have broken out among the men on account of my beauty. I am ergo very grateful for the Creator’s foresight.
Now about my eyes, they are beyond compare, (I am not being vain in the least, so don’t roll your eyes darling, I am also being very critical of myself!) I know that because I have been told so since the day of my birth. Take a good look my dear (to see is to believe after all).
My eyes are the Creator’s finest creation (my tongue comes in second, I know!), observe if you will, their similarity to a doe’s, and the length and curl of the full set of lashes is exquisite. (I told you they were beyond compare!)
Now, my eyes are the only thing I haven’t inherited from my parents. Therefore I am not reconstructing them at all by plastic. But the rest I wish to change. I like the vague outline you’ve drawn. I’ll go with that.
Now could you please quote a price that suits us both and my credit card as I am still dependent on the allowance my parents give me? That is exorbitant! 
Plastic has been banned in so many places, surely the price has fallen?
All right, I’ll take your word for it, but not because I believe you, only because I’m desperate not to look like my parents. When can you perform the surgery?
********
Hello?
I need to speak to Doctor -.
I had a plastic surgery a week ago….yes, I’ll hold.
Hello, is that you doctor?
Well, you see, no, no there is no irritation, and all my friends can hardly recognize me! They say I’m a work of art! But I didn’t call you because of that. You see, is this surgery refundable if I were to have the plastic removed? Since I did pay for the plastic…
No? Why ever not?
Well, I received the nastiest bit of news yesterday. I went over to my parents’ house, they didn’t recognize me, which was the main objective of course, but to cut a long story short, they gave me some startling news.
It turns out I’m adopted! I couldn’t believe my ears (I’m glad I didn’t change them)!But how could my eyes deceive me?
